No icons initially (let the product do the talking)

Later you could introduce:

A minimal node / route motif

But keep the demo clean

Imagery Direction (Very Important)

You were spot-on: no ambulances, no stretchers, no scrubs.

Use

Executive vehicles (side-on, understated)

Modern private clinic exteriors

Cheshire countryside / estates

Airport arrivals without crowds

Abstract interiors (lobbies, corridors, glass)

Avoid

Doctors, patients, medical procedures

Smiling stock-photo healthcare clichés

Anything NHS-coded
